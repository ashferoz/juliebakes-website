# Julie Bakes Website

As a long-time patron of Julie Bakes and a strong advocate for supporting local businesses, I wanted to give back by creating a website that beautifully showcases their delicious bakes. I had the opportunity to work closely with the team to find solutions that addressed some of their operational challenges, enabling them to use their resources more efficiently. At the same time, I was mindful of not overwhelming them with overly technical solutions, respecting their existing workflow and ensuring a smooth transition.

## Challenges

- Customers have to directly WhatsApp seller to get these information:

  - What they are selling
  - Item availability
  - Price
  - Custom orders
  - Ingredients (allergies, dietary restrictions)
  - Delivery (any extra charges based on location)
  - Bulk orders

- Client wants to retain using WhatsApp as a means to keep track of orders and communication with customers.

## Solutions

Solutions

- Website to showcase:
  - Products in categories for easier navigation
  - Price list
  - Customisation options with add on price
  - Ingredients use (categories for customers with dietary restrictions or allergies)
  - Delivery fee
  - Bulk orders limitations and price
- Order/Pick up forms will be send directly to seller via Whatsapp as per current workflow and for ease of communication between each other.
- Customers will need to key in their name and phone number (and address if delivery is opted) so that seller can send the confirmation of their orders and cost through WhatsApp
- Seller can then decide on how they want to accept their payments
- Customers can only pre-order items through websites
- For same day delivery (before 11 am) customers will be directed to sellers via WhatsApp so that they can find out on product availability and resources.
